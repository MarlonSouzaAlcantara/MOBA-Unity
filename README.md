# MOBA-Unity

This is a personal project that consist development of a game of genrer MOBA using Unity 3D and Photon Engine.

The project shown on video bellow is a prototype. The character is inspired on Ashe from League of Legends, due the "simplicity" in animation mechanics. In the first moment I focused more coding than visual aspects.

A lot of improvement and correction will be done in a future, someones like:
1) Lag compensation
2) Animation smooth.

Next steps:
1) Add arrow and sword VFX.
2) Implement the skill mechanics like (slow, stun's, faited and others..) 
3) Create new items and effects (passive, active and etc..)

Futute steps:
* Dedicated server.
