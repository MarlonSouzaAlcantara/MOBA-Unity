# MOBA-Unity

This is a personal project that consist development of a game of genrer MOBA using Unity 3D and Photon Engine.

The project shown on video bellow is a prototype. The character is inspired on Ashe from League of Legends, due the "simplicity" in animation mechanics. In the first moment I focused more coding than visual aspects.
